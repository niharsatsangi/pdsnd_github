#### **Explore U.S. Bikeshare Data**

### **Overview**
In this project, Python was used to explore data related to bike share systems for three 
major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. Code was written 
to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive 
statistics. A script was also written that takes in raw input to create an interactive 
experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

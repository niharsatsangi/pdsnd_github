## **Explore U.S. Bikeshare Data**

### **Overview**
In this project, Python was used to explore data related to bike share systems for three 
major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. Code was written 
to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive 
statistics. A script was also written that takes in raw input to create an interactive 
experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

### **Software Requirements**
To complete this project, the following software requirements apply:

* Python 3, NumPy, and pandas installed using Anaconda
* A text editor, like Sublime or Atom.
* A terminal application (Terminal on Mac and Linux or Cygwin on Windows).

### **The Datasets**
Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. 
All three of the data files contain the same core **six (6)** columns:

* Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
* End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
* Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
* Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
* End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
* User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:

* Gender
* Birth Year

### **Statistics Computed**
In this project, you'll write code to provide the following information:

1. Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)

	* most common month
	* most common day of week
	* most common hour of day

2. Popular stations and trip

	* most common start station
	* most common end station
	* most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

3. Trip duration

	* total travel time
	* average travel time

4. User info

	* counts of each user type
	* counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
	* earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)

### **The Files**
To help guide the work in this project, a template with helper code and comments is provided in a bikeshare_2.py 
file, and the scripting will be done in there also. The following three city dataset files will be needed too:

* chicago.csv
* new_york_city.csv
* washington.csv

Some versions of this project also include a Project Workspace page in the classroom where the bikeshare.py 
file and the city dataset files are all included, and the work can be done with them there.

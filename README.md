#### **Explore U.S. Bikeshare Data**

### **Overview**
In this project, Python was used to explore data related to bike share systems for three 
major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. Code was written 
to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive 
statistics. A script was also written that takes in raw input to create an interactive 
experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

### **Software Requirements**
To complete this project, the following software requirements apply:

* Python 3, NumPy, and pandas installed using Anaconda
* A text editor, like Sublime or Atom.
* A terminal application (Terminal on Mac and Linux or Cygwin on Windows).
